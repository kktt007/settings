1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:03,836
6 years ago, I was taken
from prison and forced

2
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:06,939
to become an assassin for a
secret unit of the government...

3
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:10,609
a black ops program called
division that has now gone rogue.

4
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:12,611
They destroyed my identity,

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:14,780
and they destroyed
the man I loved.

6
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:18,751
I escaped. And now the man that
trained me... someone I trusted...

7
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,719
is hunting me.

8
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,324
What division doesn't know is that I
have a partner on the inside, Alex.

9
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,628
A new recruit with a dark past, who I've
trained in secret to resist their control.

10
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,067
Together, we're going to take
division apart one mission at a time.

11
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,139
And the last word they'll breathe
before the end will be my name...

12
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,657
An I.D. on the target yet?

13
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:02,027
Jill Morelli.
She's a freelance reporter.

14
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:03,495
28 years old.

15
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,567
Also runs a blog that tracks
governments conspiracies. Awkward.

16
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,069
How did she get wind of our op?

17
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:11,370
Who talked to her?

18
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:12,604
We're not sure.

19
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:13,672
I hacked into her home PC.

20
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,508
There's no mention
of the op in there.

21
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,111
But she knows we were
at the crash site.

22
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:20,813
The girl's cracked
some major scandals.

23
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,915
But she's attracted
just as many libel suits.

24
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,583
Most of the major papers
won't touch her.

25
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:26,585
It only takes one, right?

26
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:28,587
Agent Donegan, use grab team B.

27
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,923
I want to find out
exactly what she knows

28
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,225
and how she came to know it.

29
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:41,131
Donegan, I'll get you the
coordinates for the target.

30
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,203
This is the operations room.

31
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:46,939
The window looks out
into the training area

32
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,908
so the all-mighty parents
can look down on the kids.

33
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,878
Most of their key intel
passes through that hub.

34
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,149
When a new target comes in, operations
becomes the most popular club in town.

35
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,418
If we're going
to sabotage division,

36
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,821
that's one of the veins I'm
going to need you to tap.

37
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,556
Doesn't the window
work both ways?

38
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,225
Gold star.

39
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,394
The glass is tinted.
So, you're going to have to get close.

40
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,597
The problem is,
you can't just walk up

41
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,934
and press your nose against it
like a kid in a candy store.

42
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,412
Jaden.

43
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,315
I'm just looking
for a sparring partner.

44
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:32,484
Find someone else, newbie.

45
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:34,586
You and I are supposed
to play nice.

46
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:35,921
Oh, I forgot.

47
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,556
We're still on probation

48
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,791
because of the whole
you attacking me thing.

49
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:42,427
I got nothin'
to say about that.

50
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,464
There's something
about me you should know.

51
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:53,405
Aah!

52
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,812

Yeah. It'll be fine, honey.
Just reheat it when I get home.

59
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,842
No. No. I'm in the garage now.

60

Yeah. I'm losing you.

Damnit!

63
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,387
Morelli, you scared
the hell out of me!

64
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,691
Oh, sorry, Jer. But I'm sitting
on the story of the year here.

65
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,459
And Joanne won't put
my calls through to you.

66
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:48,894
I just need 2 minutes.

67
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:50,829
You got 10 seconds
till I get to my car.

68
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,197
It's about air America flight

69
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:53,565
that crashed in the
Appalachian mountains.

70
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,300
112 dead. No survivors.

71
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:56,902
Every paper in the country
is covering that story.

72
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,071
Yeah? Which one's got
the exclusive

73
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:00,572
on the black helicopters?

74
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,442
What black helicopters, Jill?

75
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,178
What black helicopters, Jill?

76
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,380
The ones my source saw
land at the crash site

77
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:12,150
before the huge forest fire conveniently
burned up all the evidence.

78
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,252
Evidence of what?

79
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,021
Exactly. When I called
Air America for comment,

80
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:19,258
they put me on hold.
And guess who picked up the line.

81
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,093
Henry Sampson.

82
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,594
You spoke to Henry Sampson?

83
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:27,299
Yeah. Since when does
a CEO of a major airline

84
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,335
pick up the phone to talk
to a freelance journo?

85

I've heard that before.

89
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:40,612
My source has video
of the crash site.

90
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,048
Yeah? How much does
your source want this time?

91
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,184
50 grand. But how can you
put a price to the truth?

92
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:49,788
We're not TMZ, Jill.
We don't pay for stories.

162
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,617
The plane crash.
That's what we were talking about.

163
00:08:15,053 --> 00:08:17,053
Those hit men wanted me
to give up my source.

164
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,555
Listen, it's going to be ok.

165
00:08:19,424 --> 00:08:20,324
We're going to expose
what they're trying to hide.

166
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:21,425
But you have to tell me
what that is.

167
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,760
I don't know.

168
00:08:26,831 --> 00:08:27,698
All right, I hacked
the state police server

169
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,833
and put out an APB
for Jill Morelli.

170
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:32,035
Got her wanted in connection
with the murder of her editor.

171
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:34,271
Just heard from the on-site team.
Target apartment secure.

172
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:35,506
No sign of Nikita.

173
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,573
Patch me through.

174
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:38,609
I listed Morelli
as armed and dangerous.

175
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,576
You wanna go federal?

176
00:08:41,012 --> 00:08:42,179
What's the last
confirmed location?

177
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,783
Cell phone pinged off a tower
in Brooklyn at 1:07 am.

178
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:49,286
Nikita must have dumped it right
after you guys botched the job.

179
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,690
They could be a couple hundred
miles in any direction by now.

180
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:55,559
Widen the net.
Tri-state area.

181
00:08:56,194 --> 00:08:56,560
On-site team on 3.

182
00:08:56,961 --> 00:08:58,028
Any leads?

183
00:08:59,197 --> 00:09:01,197
Man: There's a whole bunch
of material in here...

184
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,533
notepads, bulletin boards,
file cabinets.

185
00:09:06,104 --> 00:09:06,470
Ok. Clean it out. Bring it here...
all of it... now.

186
00:09:06,704 --> 00:09:07,471
Yes, sir.

187
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:09,640
Tell Percy I need to see him.

188
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:15,077
A couple of days ago this guy
contacted me through my site.

189
00:09:15,613 --> 00:09:17,613
Said he had some video
that would blow my mind.

190
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:20,283
Air America crash,
2 helicopters,

191
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:22,552
some paramilitary operation.

192
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:23,820
He wouldn't give me specifics.

193
00:09:26,157 --> 00:09:26,523
Made me drive out to Virginia
just to meet him.

194
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:28,158
Young guy.

195
00:09:30,562 --> 00:09:32,562
Scared of what he saw,
not faking it.

196
00:09:33,498 --> 00:09:34,531
Wanted $50,000
just to show me the video.

197
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:38,501
So, you went to "the
post" for the 50,000?

198
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:39,469
I was hoping for 5.

199
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,971
Maybe.

200
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,141
The guy's supposed to call me
at 1:00 pm tomorrow.

201
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:46,410
Wait. What day is this?

202
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:47,811
It's tomorrow.

203
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,047
What's your source's name?

204
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:52,916
I don't know.
He wouldn't tell me.

205
00:09:53,818 --> 00:09:55,118
What's his number?

206
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:56,786
He has my number.

207
00:09:58,156 --> 00:09:59,056
What... what happened
to my phone?

208
00:09:59,757 --> 00:10:00,424
I took the battery
and the SIM card out

209
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:01,692
so they couldn't trace you.

210
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:04,728
You got a boyfriend?
Roommate?

211
00:10:05,863 --> 00:10:07,197
No. Why?

212
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:11,068
Well, because those men are
definitely at your house by now.

213
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:12,436
Let's call the police.

214
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:15,472
Oh, no.
They control the police.

215
00:10:18,343 --> 00:10:20,843
Right now they're doing everything
they can to hunt you down.

216
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,013
I thought you said they won't
be able to find me here.

217
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:25,182
You're not staying here.

218
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:29,185
You have a very important
phone call in...

219
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
42 minutes.

220
00:10:33,558 --> 00:10:34,758
Percy: Nikita's making
good on her threat.

221
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:37,461
Third time she's interfered
with one of our missions.

222
00:10:38,062 --> 00:10:39,362
That we know of.

223
00:10:39,364 --> 00:10:40,230
What we do know is that

224
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:42,199
she's been ahead of us
at each step.

225
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:45,134
At a certain point
we have to consider

226
00:10:46,371 --> 00:10:46,870
the possibility of
a leak from the inside.

227
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:48,372
A high level leak.

228
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:50,507
I'd like to rule out
a data breach

229
00:10:51,376 --> 00:10:52,142
before we start a mole hunt.

230
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,379
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Data breach?

231
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,114
No way. No.

232
00:10:57,815 --> 00:10:58,615
Our network is Fort Knox.

233
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,384
Internal servers
are air gapped,

234
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:02,552
and I run routine tests
on the outer defenses.

235
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:04,855
We're talking
5-tier security

236
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:07,924
with protocols that rotate
every hour on the hour.

237
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,594
That's proprietary software.

238
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,566
Only person who could dream of
hacking into division is me.

239
00:11:22,273 --> 00:11:23,507
What?

240
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:27,811
Well, you did have a prolonged
interaction with Nikita

241
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,913
directly following
her reappearance.

242
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,483
If by interaction you
mean kidnap and torture,

243
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,452
yeah, you debriefed me,
remember?

244
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:37,587
A debriefing
that Nikita allowed

245
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,690
by allowing you
to return to us.

246
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:43,160
Dude, she pistol-whipped
my face.

247
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,062
What are we even talking
about here?

248
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:47,898
Take him down to see Amanda.
I'll call and give her instructions.

249
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:49,633
What the hell is this?
I'm not the mole.

250
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,669
Well, then you have nothing
to worry about.

251
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,508
So, he calls me and I let it
go to voicemail, of course.

252
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:04,046
I can't even check it.
His voice reminds me of his face.

253
00:12:04,716 --> 00:12:05,315
It's disgusting.
What part of "I don't like you"

254
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,717
does he not understand?

255
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,152
We have to check out that
new wine bar this weekend.

256
00:12:10,922 --> 00:12:12,222
Ohh. I love
wine bars.

257
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,690
I know you do.

258
00:12:17,395 --> 00:12:18,695
Whose office is this?

259
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:21,531
Don't know. It'll work.

260
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:23,467
Well, what if they come back
when we're in here?

261
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:25,302
Nobody's coming back.
It's lunchtime.

262
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:28,104
Your boy's going
to call in 2 minutes.

263
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:29,472
We've got 15 before we...

264
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:31,074
What are you doing?

265
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:33,543
I always eat when I'm nervous.

266
00:12:34,312 --> 00:12:35,178
Jill, the second
I turn on this phone,

267
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,813
they're going
to know where we are.

268
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:39,115
I'm going to need you
to get your source

269
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:40,350
to agree to a trade
for the video fast.

270
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:41,885
What if he asks for the money?

271
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:43,787
You have it.

272
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:45,656
[Beep]

273
00:12:50,027 --> 00:12:50,827
Ok. I've got a hit
on the target phone.

274
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:53,063
Getting its twenty
from the GPS.

275
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,299
It's either a trick or she
needs to receive a call.

276
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,701
Are we up the carrier?

277
00:13:01,005 --> 00:13:03,505
Yeah. But it looks like they've
got call forwarding enabled.

278
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,008
She's talking to the source.

279
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,244
It's 1:05.
Where the hell is he?

280
00:13:09,046 --> 00:13:10,046
I don't know.

00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,415
[Buzzing]

[Phone rings]

283
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:15,786
Hello.

284
00:13:17,555 --> 00:13:19,555
Man: Hey. It's me. How'd it
go with your editor?

285
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,958
Um, it was good.
I have the money.

286
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:24,327
What is it?
Is it cash? Check?

287
00:13:24,996 --> 00:13:25,996
It's check.

288
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,331
I just need to know
who to write it out to.

289
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:30,734
Ok. Ok. I want you to take
a picture of the check

290
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:33,402
and upload it
to my flicker account.

291
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:35,705
This is Malia Watson, Jill's editor.

292
00:13:35,907 --> 00:13:36,973
What in the world
is on this video?

293
00:13:37,508 --> 00:13:38,842
And why in the world
would I pay you $50,000

294
00:13:40,044 --> 00:13:41,144
for something that's probably
been mocked up on your desktop?

295
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:42,979
You know, you'll just have
to see it for yourself.

296
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,215
Honey, I don't have time
for games.

297
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,850
Better luck with
"the enquirer." Be well.

298
00:13:49,353 --> 00:13:50,554
Wait. You have to understand.
I never meant to see this.

299
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:52,923
I was just hiking off the trail
when I heard the crash.

300
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:58,393
And... and I ran over, and when
I got there, it was just...

301
00:13:58,663 --> 00:13:59,496
wreckage everywhere.

302
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:01,398
And... and I heard
these helicopters,

303
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:03,200
so I thought
it was search and rescue.

304
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:05,035
Are these the so-called
black helicopters?

305
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,771
Yeah. And the guys that repelled
out of them were like commandoes.

306
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:09,306
Instead of looking
for survivors,

307
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,342
they start hauling these
huge bags out of the wreck.

308
00:14:13,444 --> 00:14:14,511
The bags were packed
with cocaine.

309
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:17,246
It was like the whole plane
was packed with coke

310
00:14:17,348 --> 00:14:19,348
and these guys were just
grabbing it out.

311
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:21,685
How do you know it was cocaine?

312
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,154
It was either that or someone was
about to bake a really big cake.

313
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:28,091
Ok, kid. We have the money.
You have the video.

Where do you wanna meet
for the trade?

The quad at
north Virginia state, ok?

316
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:34,931
Tomorrow. 10:00 am.

00:14:44,742 --> 00:14:46,242
Was that really necessary?!

00:14:57,255 --> 00:14:59,255
Great spot to hide
from the trace.

319
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,691
Where do you want us to start?

320
00:15:07,648 --> 00:15:08,948
Percy told me what's going on.

321
00:15:11,852 --> 00:15:13,186
And I have to agree, there's
something off with your story.

322
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,789
I didn't do anything, Amanda.
Why don't you guys believe me?

323
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:19,192
I believe that you
believe that, Birkhoff.

324
00:15:19,593 --> 00:15:20,827
[Scoffs] Great.

325
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:23,396
Psycho babble.
How much you charging for this session?

326
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,631
I only want you
to open up to me.

327
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:26,166
You can tell me anything.

328
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,867
No. No. No.

329
00:15:30,704 --> 00:15:33,204
You are trying to get me to admit
to something that I didn't do.

330
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,807
What did you and Nikita talk
about when she captured you?

331
00:15:37,845 --> 00:15:39,845
Oh, we've been over this
1,000 times.

332
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:44,049
She told me she wanted
to burn down division.

333
00:15:46,287 --> 00:15:47,787
I told her she was insane.

334
00:15:49,757 --> 00:15:50,623
And you and Nikita were
comrades when she served here.

335
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:52,392
Did you ever have
feelings for her?

336
00:15:53,394 --> 00:15:54,594
You know what?

337
00:15:56,897 --> 00:15:57,931
I'm getting a feeling right
now like I was kidnapped

338
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,166
and now I'm being framed
for giving her intel!

339
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:03,369
Birkhoff, I'm not holding it
against you.

340
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,406
If you have an emotional connection
to Nikita, it's perfectly natural.

341
00:16:09,643 --> 00:16:10,143
Coworkers often develop physical and
emotional attractions for one another.

342
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:13,446
She was a recruit.

343
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:14,581
A super hot one, yeah.

344
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:17,517
But I know the rules.
Look, but don't touch.

345
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:20,219
She's not a recruit anymore.

346
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,155
Whose fault is that?

347
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,592
Ever since
she held you hostage,

348
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:30,495
Nikita has had access to highly
confidential information.

349
00:16:31,098 --> 00:16:32,098
And if you had done your job,

350
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:35,735
Nikita would still be
serving us right now.

351
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:38,705
You see...

352
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,407
You're the one who screwed
the pooch, Amanda.

353
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:44,811
You were supposed to mold her into
this perfect, obedient Agent.

354
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:50,582
But the second girlfriend got a
chance to split, she took it.

355
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:56,322
Where you going?

356
00:16:57,324 --> 00:16:58,124
Martin?

357
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:58,758
Oh.

358
00:16:59,526 --> 00:16:59,926
Take him to medical.

359
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:01,628
Oh, come on.

360
00:17:03,497 --> 00:17:03,930
I wanna run an FMRI
brain scan for lie detection.

361
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:06,633
I'm not lying.

362
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:08,301
Ok. All right.

363
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,169
Full body cavity search
as well.

364
00:17:12,006 --> 00:17:13,506
That... that is overkill,
Amanda!

365
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:14,974
Ow! Ow! Amanda!

366
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:17,877
Tell me you found the video.

367
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,314
We're still looking
for the source.

368
00:17:23,784 --> 00:17:24,384
I would like your permission
to enlist some of the recruits

369
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:26,252
to help with the trace.

370
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:29,889
We've emptied the reporter's apartment,
her public storage locker,

371
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:31,324
brought everything here.

372
00:17:34,194 --> 00:17:34,594
I get it. Too much material
to sift through on the clock.

373
00:17:34,995 --> 00:17:36,195
Fine. Do it.

374
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:40,533
I also would like to give them
the target's full profile.

375
00:17:41,168 --> 00:17:42,001
Absolutely not.

376
00:17:42,803 --> 00:17:44,803
Like you said,
we're on the clock.

377
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:47,139
Redacting intel
will only slow us down.

378
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:48,574
If we give them a full profile,

379
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:51,511
it will invariably prompt
the inane moral debate

380
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,313
about the target
being a good person.

381
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,783
Last thing we need right now is for another
recruit to discover their inner Nikita.

382
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:01,887
Tell them it's
a training exercise.

383
00:18:06,593 --> 00:18:07,694
All right, listen up.

384
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:10,797
We're running a training exercise.
3-man units.

385
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:12,899
This will be a competition.

386
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:15,768
Team leaders, pick your people.

387
00:18:16,937 --> 00:18:17,737
Jaden.

388
00:18:19,173 --> 00:18:19,706
Alex.

389
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,307
What are you doing?

390
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:24,143
I'm trying to save your life.
Both of yours.

391
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:27,413
You guys were given an ultimatum
that came straight from operations.

392
00:18:30,684 --> 00:18:31,217
Show visible improvement in the
next 2 weeks or get cancelled.

393
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:32,652
That was a week ago.

394
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:34,754
How do you think you're doing?

395
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:37,023
If anyone else here
fails this test,

396
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,493
they'll meal penalty or maybe
solitary at the worst.

397
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:44,197
If either of you fail,
you may not be coming back.

398
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:47,667
Good evening.

399
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,071
This exercise is designed to
test your tracking skills.

400
00:18:52,773 --> 00:18:53,673
You'll be examining
evidence collected

401
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:55,108
from the home
of a domestic terrorist,

402
00:18:56,243 --> 00:18:57,443
who was planning to meet
a munitions expert.

403
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:01,080
Now, their goal was to destroy
a government facility.

404
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:06,251
Your task is to uncover the
identity of the munitions expert

405
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:07,253
and where the meet
was going to take place.

406
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:12,591
Our agents were able
to do this in 12 hours.

407
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,960
Let's see if you can do better.

408
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,301
15 minutes, ok?
Then we're back in the car.

409
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:27,939
Got 90 miles to go,
and we gotta take back roads.

410
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,610
No more nervous appetite?

411
00:19:32,646 --> 00:19:33,513
I keep seeing Jeremy's face.

412
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:36,883
He was starring
right at me when...

413
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:38,551
you didn't kill him, Jill.

414
00:19:39,486 --> 00:19:40,486
They did.

415
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:41,120
And why?

416
00:19:42,856 --> 00:19:43,156
For what? For money?

417
00:19:43,424 --> 00:19:44,357
Yeah.

418
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:46,659
For a lot of money.
Think about it, ok.

419
00:19:49,163 --> 00:19:50,663
Henry Sampson is using passenger
planes to smuggle drugs.

420
00:19:54,868 --> 00:19:57,368
Probably to keep from going under
like all the other airline companies.

421
00:19:57,504 --> 00:19:58,271
A real-life
story of the year.

422
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:00,606
Jeremy would have loved this.

423
00:20:03,477 --> 00:20:06,477
Well, when we get this video, you're going
to make sure your article gets published.

424
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,947
Yeah.
If we get the video.

425
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:12,016
Those guys coming after us
aren't airline security.

426
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,320
They're the commando guys
from the crash site.

427
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:16,989
Who are they?

428
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,859
Come on! You said before I
was on the right track.

429
00:20:21,895 --> 00:20:22,495
Some kind of government
black ops unit?

430
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:24,330
Maybe even mercenaries?

431
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:26,799
You need to stick
with what you can prove.

432
00:20:28,168 --> 00:20:29,469
If this video turns out to be
what all it's cracked up to be,

433
00:20:31,138 --> 00:20:32,672
you get to prove that a fortune
500 CEO is smuggling drugs.

434
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:36,976
You will never be able to prove who
the guys were in the helicopters.

435
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:38,578
Why?

436
00:20:39,713 --> 00:20:40,713
Because they don't have decals on
their vehicles or their clothing.

437
00:20:41,815 --> 00:20:42,515
Because there's no record
that they exist,

438
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:44,150
no documentation, no evidence.

439
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:47,753
What about you? You were part of them.
You're evidence.

440
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:49,555
I don't exist either.

441
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:52,591
Why won't you tell me
what you know?

442
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:53,392
Why are you protecting them?

443
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,194
I'm protecting you, Jill.

444
00:20:57,865 --> 00:20:58,431
You don't think that if I could have
gone to the press to take them down,

445
00:20:58,532 --> 00:20:59,665
I would have done it?

446
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:04,535
You won't be the first reporter
I've seen them kill.

447
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:07,572
Yeah. Well, I won't let
Jeremy die for nothing.

448
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:10,909
I have to tell
the whole story, Nikita.

449
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:11,878
I owe him at least that much.

450
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,913
We gotta go.

451
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:19,417
Now, get up. Put your head down.
Follow me.

452
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,795
Excuse me, miss?

453
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,170
Go! Go! Go!
We gotta lose the car.

454
00:21:37,738 --> 00:21:38,437
They're gonna know
where we are.

455
00:21:38,772 --> 00:21:39,572
But you just knocked them out!

456
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:43,308
I'm not talking about the cops.

457
00:21:47,414 --> 00:21:48,414
[Tires squeal]

458
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:53,845
Got a hit on Nikita.
90 miles outside of Blacksburg off highway 81.

459
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:55,446
Still have the reporter
with her?

460
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,582
2 highway patrol officers
recognized Morelli

461
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:58,650
from the bulletin we sent out.

462
00:21:59,418 --> 00:21:59,851
Nikita slipped the net.

463
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,352
Ahh. Amateurs.

464
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:02,754
Alpha team's en route
to Virginia.

465
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,122
We got a chopper there.

466
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,959
I wanna see this first.
Find out how she breached us.

467
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:11,729
It's you.

468
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:13,398
I'm not the mole, genius.

469
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:14,832
It's my molar.

470
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,301
Second bicuspid actually,
lower left.

471
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,138
I had medical
run an FMRI on Birkhoff.

472
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:22,774
Imagine my surprise when it showed
a tiny wireless transmitter

473
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,442
imbedded in his tooth.

474
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:27,178
Nikita must have planted it
there when he was passed out.

475
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,212
Possibly.

476
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:30,581
Possibly?
I think I'd remember that.

477
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,083
He passed the lie detection.

478
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:34,819
She had to remove the cap
in order to insert the bug.

479
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,055
You must have felt
that afterwards.

480
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,158
Oh, I felt it.
My whole face was sore for like a week

481
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,395
after she got done with me.
Why are you smiling?

482
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,098
Look. Just get it
out of there.

483
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:51,469
Get what out of where?

484
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,010
Amanda, I'm totally sorry
about that whole

485
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,579
"you're bad at your job" thing.

486
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:04,315
And I completely take it back.

487
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:06,951
Please.

488
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:10,655
Drugs, please.

489
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:12,924
[Door closes]

490
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:15,426
Describe him again.

491
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,130
Early twenties.
African American.

492
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:21,466
Kinda hipster cute.

493
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,101
Hipster cute?

494
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,304
Yeah, you know.
An ironic t-shirt kinda guy.

495
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,506
With the big jeans.
Hangs out in the coffee shops...

496
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,208
yeah. I get it.

497
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,976
You know, maybe we got
the location wrong.

498
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,145
Maybe he's waiting
for us somewhere else

499
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:37,115
and can't call us 'cause
you stomped on my phone.

500
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:38,316
We're at the right place.

501
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,051
He's just not going to show up.

502
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:41,452
Probably saw the news.

503
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,154
What news?

504
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:45,957
That you're wanted for murder.
He's paranoid.

505
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:48,593
Ok, what do we do now?
I mean, we're screwed.

506
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:55,164
We're going to track him
down ourselves. Come on.

507
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,139
These notebooks are just
conspiracy theory crap.

508
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,341
I mean, what are we supposed
to be looking for anyway?

509
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,045
Behavioral patterns,
motives, potential targets.

510
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,015
There's a bunch of stuff in here on a plane crash.
Maybe she caused it.

511
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,186
They said the terrorist was targeting
a government facility not a plane.

512
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,822
The Pentagon? A plane
crashed into that.

513
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:20,992
Yeah. And there's a conspiracy
theory on that in here, too.

514
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:23,528
Why are the names blacked out?

515
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:25,863
They don't want to
make it easy on us.

516
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:27,365
I do you know it's a she.

517
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,499
What?

518
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,902
The terrorist. What makes
you think its a woman?

519
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,208
Smell. Grapefruit
and vanilla-scented candles.

520
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:40,778
All right, show-off.
I'll see your scented candles,

521
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,614
and I'll raise you this.

522
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:44,816
Handwritten note.

523
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,318
Video on
A.T. Stony Creek.

524
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:50,421
Maybe a.T. Are the initials
of the munitions expert.

525
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:53,057
Stony Creek's in Virginia.

526
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:54,959
Plane crash was in Virginia.

527
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:57,662
A.T. could be
Appalachian trail.

528
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,231
Not bad.

529
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:03,434
All right, anything not tied to
Virginia moves off the table.

530
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:04,802
Let's get a map.

531
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:07,305
Where's the movie theater
you first met him at?

532
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,906
Right here.

533
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,210
He asked you to meet him at 2 different
locations near the university.

534
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:16,646
He was hiking the day of the
crash, which was a Wednesday.

535
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,748
He's not a 9-5'er.
He's a college student.

536
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:19,884
One without a set of wheels.

537
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,719
Both locations
are on this bus route.

538
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:24,488
And I found 3 sporting goods
store along that line.

539
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:25,890
Right.

540
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,993
Wait. Why do we care about
sporting goods all of a sudden?

541
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:33,631
Our student's a hiker. An ambitious one
if he got up to where the crash happened.

542
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,233
That's way off trail.

543
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,870
He'd need some serious gear
to get up there.

544
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,039
Come on. Let's go shopping.

545
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:43,808
Jaden: Blacksburg
is in Virginia.

546
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,611
Yeah. But the date on that ticket
stub is after the plane crash.

547
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,380
You said the plane crash didn't matter anyway.
I'm telling you...

548
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,082
no, we don't. We need to finish
to finish this profile before...

549
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:53,317
Michael.
What are you doing?

550
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,689
Alex here seems to
have it all figured out.

551
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,425
Well...

552
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,563
There's a lot of evidence that points to
Virginia as either the target location

553
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,066
or the meeting place between our
terrorist and the munitions expert.

554
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:10,768
Continue.

555
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:13,304
This is a ticket stub
to a theater in Blacksburg.

556
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:15,473
3:15 matinee of
"Elmo: The movie."

557
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:18,142
So far, our terrorist is
female, college-educated,

558
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,278
no kids, based in Brooklyn.

559
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:23,514
Driving all the way to Virginia to
see an Elmo movie is way weird.

560
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:24,982
So, that's where they met?

561
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:26,817
Maybe.
Definitely.

562
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,287
This is one of those
theaters with assigned seats.

563
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,655
Row G, seat 12.

564
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:33,791
And this is a stub G-11...
the person sitting next to her.

565
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
We know exactly
where they were sitting.

566
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:40,297
On Sunday the 10th
between 3:15 and 5:00 pm.

567
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,132
That's not bad.

568
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,001
We're after 100% confirmation.

569
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:47,071
If there are cameras,
you can get it.

570
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,673
What do you mean?

571
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,280
Tell him what you told me.

572
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:57,415
Hey, what's she doing in here?

573
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:00,418
Operations is off-limits
to recruits.

574
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:01,752
Go on.

575
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:04,622
Ok. I used to have
this friend Zeke,

576
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,023
and he used to bootleg DVDs

577
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:08,025
until they started putting
night vision cameras

578
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,260
inside the movie theaters.

579
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:12,363
Lyric theater
in Blacksburg, Virginia.

580
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,733
Think we can access
their security footage?

581
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,303
Who do you think
you're talking to?

582
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,009
10th. 3:15 showing
in auditorium 4.

583
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,347
"Elmo: The movie"?
This is creepy.

584
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:31,749
G 11, G 12.

585
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:36,086
A, b, c...
get closer in on that couple.

586
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:36,654
Hey.

587
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,189
There's our reporter.

588
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:41,892
Reporter? I thought you said
this was an inactive mission.

589
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,362
And that must be her source.
Just for training.

590
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,098
How long before facial recognition can
pinpoint the name of the new guy?

591
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:54,237
Don't need it. Dude used his credit
card to buy that tub of popcorn.

592
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:57,375
Benjamin Prentice.

593
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:58,442
Member of the outdoors club.

594
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,645
Great. Get me
his home address.

595
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:03,381
Gold star.

596
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:05,850
Wait. I wanna
go on the mission.

597
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:07,518
Maybe next time.

598
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:10,054
Why don't you stay
here with Birkhoff

599
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,589
and observe from operations?

600
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,659
You've earned it.

601
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,946
Ok, Michael. You are 5 miles
from destination.

602
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,416
Head east in 400 feet.

603
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:40,217
Or don't. Whatever.

604
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,485
Michael: Copy that.

605
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,887
Pretty cool how you can hack
into all these servers.

606
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:45,589
Local theaters.
Local police.

607
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,523
FBI?

608
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,659
It's called ownage, girl.

609
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,296
I don't have to hack Jack.
All these systems are already hacked.

610
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:55,532
I own them.
One button. Boom.

611
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:01,037
"Sneakers." River Phoenix.
Rent it. What's up?

612
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:04,274
Division's lucky to have you.

613
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,543
Tell that to Percy
and the dragon queen.

614
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,047
They thought I was a mole.
Fascists.

615
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:12,916
[Doorbell rings]

616
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:20,824
Nikita: Ben!

617
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,260
Prentice!

618
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,029
Ok. Please! Please!
Don't hurt me.

619
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:27,831
Ok. Prentice.
Don't be a wuss.

620
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,900
Nobody gets hurt.
We just want to see the video.

621
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:33,904
It's gone. I trashed it right
after I saw you kill that guy.

622
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,072
I didn't kill anybody.

623
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:36,673
Ben, we know you have it.

624
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:38,809
And if we have to waste time
looking for it,

625
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,144
the real killers...
the ones in the video...

626
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:41,512
they're gonna show up.

627
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,013
How are they going to find me?

628
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,516
The manager at ace sporting
goods... your buddy...

629
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,586
he was really helpful. He'd thought
you'd enjoy a visit from 2 hot babes.

630
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,122
It's going to be a lot easier
for the black helicopter guys

631
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:55,591
unless we get that video
